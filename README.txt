Semester Project "Linearization of gas-electricity optimal power flow using sensitivity coefficients"
Matthieu Bossert - Autumn-Winter 2023-2024

File structure:
Data: contains csv input for the grid parameters and different scenarios
results: output folder of the main script results
AGA.m: linear interpolation of the pipe friction coefficient
AGA_vec.m: generates the look-up table of friction coefficients for all pipe in the network using the American Gas Association correlation formula
Coeffs_Currents.m: returns the 2D matrix of current sensitivity coefficients and the current in each branch of the power network
Coeffs_Losses.m: returns the sensitivity coefficients for the losses in the power grid
Coeffs_Voltage_Alpha: returns the voltage sensitivity coefficients
coupled_networks.m: main script of the project. Initialize the networks, solves linear model and generate the graphs
gas_properties_struct.mat: struct containing the natural gas properties, generated by get_gasproperties.m
get_gasproperties.m: generate the properties of natural gas using the python coolrpop library (necessites to install coolprop)
NR_polar_sol.m: Applies newton raphson to the grid power flow equations in polar coordinate
NR_weymouth.m: Applies newton raphson method to the gas weymouth load flow equations
pressure_coeff: computes the pressure sensitivity coefficients for the gas network
Ymatrix: returns the impedance matrix of the power grid
